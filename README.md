## VIRTUAL ASSISTANT using Wolfram Alpha and Wikipedia

The **VIRTUAL-ASSISTANT** project is a virtual assistant implementation that leverages the capabilities of Wolfram Alpha and Wikipedia to provide intelligent responses to user queries. This README provides an overview of the project, its features, usage instructions, and examples.
The VIRTUAL-ASSISTANT project is a versatile virtual assistant application that integrates Wolfram Alpha and Wikipedia to provide users with intelligent responses and information retrieval capabilities. This project enables users to interact with the virtual assistant through text or voice commands, leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques to understand queries and fetch relevant data from two powerful knowledge sources.

Project Objectives
The main objective of the VIRTUAL-ASSISTANT project is to create a user-friendly and informative virtual assistant capable of answering a wide range of questions and inquiries. Key goals of this project include:

The **VIRTUAL-ASSISTANT** is designed to interact with users through text or voice commands, interpreting natural language queries and fetching relevant information from Wolfram Alpha and Wikipedia. This project combines the power of knowledge-based systems and information retrieval to deliver informative and contextually accurate responses.

### Key Features and Functionality

- **Natural Language Understanding**:
  - Utilizes speech recognition or text processing techniques to understand user queries.

- **Knowledge Retrieval**:
  - Accesses Wolfram Alpha's computational knowledge engine and Wikipedia's vast information database to answer a wide range of questions.

- **Interactive Communication**:
  - Engages users in conversational interactions, providing educational and factual responses.

### Prerequisites

Before using the **VIRTUAL-ASSISTANT** project, ensure you have the following:

- Python (version 3.x recommended)
- Required Python libraries (install using `pip`):
  - `wolframalpha` for accessing Wolfram Alpha API
  - `wikipedia-api` for interacting with Wikipedia
  - `SpeechRecognition` for speech-to-text functionality (optional)

Install the dependencies using:

```bash
pip install wolframalpha wikipedia-api SpeechRecognition
```

### Usage Instructions

1. **Obtain API Keys**:

   - Obtain an API key for Wolfram Alpha from [developer.wolframalpha.com/portal/myapps](https://developer.wolframalpha.com/portal/myapps).

2. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anaumsharif/VIRTUAL-ASSISTANT.git
   ```

3. **Navigate to Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd virtual-assistant
   ```

4. **Set API Keys**:

   - Replace `YOUR_WOLFRAM_ALPHA_APP_ID` in `virtual_assistant.py` with your Wolfram Alpha API key.

5. **Run the Virtual Assistant**:

   Execute the `virtual_assistant.py` script to start the virtual assistant:

   ```bash
   python virtual_assistant.py
   ```

6. **Interact with the Virtual Assistant**:

   Once the virtual assistant is running, input your queries through text or voice commands. The assistant will utilize Wolfram Alpha and Wikipedia to provide responses.

### Project Structure

The **VIRTUAL-ASSISTANT** project consists of the following components:

- **`virtual_assistant.py`**:
  - Main script that implements the virtual assistant functionality.
  - Handles user interactions, processes queries, and retrieves information from Wolfram Alpha and Wikipedia.

### Examples

Interact with the virtual assistant by asking questions or providing topics of interest:

```
User: What is the population of France?
Virtual Assistant: The population of France is approximately 67 million.

User: Who is Isaac Newton?
Virtual Assistant: Sir Isaac Newton was an English mathematician, physicist, and astronomer who formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation.

User: How far is the Moon from Earth?
Virtual Assistant: The average distance from the Moon to Earth is about 384,400 kilometers.
```
